LUDUM DARE 46
The theme is... _Keep it alive.___________

IDEAS:
* Space invaders-like game - protect enemies from getting to a single point.
* Maze-like game with a rolling ball. Get to the end before "it" dies.
* Keeping a concept "alive". Don't let something go out of fashion?
* Heart - Love Alive

CHOSEN IDEA:
* You are a "blood system" - you need to drop each blood cell into the right "tubes" (veins/vessels),
  or else the heart will fail, and become *non-alive*.
